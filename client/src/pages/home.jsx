      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>My mission is to build thoughtful, user-focused web experiences that solve real problems and help people connect. 
        I strive to learn continuously, adapt as technologies evolve, and bring creativity and attention to detail into every project. 
        Through my work, I aim to leave a positive impact—whether it’s by crafting an intuitive interface, writing clean, 
        maintainable code, or collaborating openly with others. Ultimately, I want to use my skills to turn ideas into practical, 
        reliable solutions that make life a little easier for users.</p>
