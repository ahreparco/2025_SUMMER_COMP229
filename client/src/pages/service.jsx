            Website Development
            <p>
                I build responsive, interactive websites using React for the front end and Node.js 
                with Express on the back end. Each site is tailored to your brand and goals.

            API Creation and Integration
            <p>
                I design and implement RESTful APIs that let your front end communicate securely with your database. 
                If you need to connect to third party services, I handle authentication and data flow so everything 
                works seamlessly.

            Database Design and Management
            <p>
                I set up and optimize MongoDB databases for fast queries and reliable data storage. 
                This includes creating schemas, writing efficient queries, and ensuring your data stays consistent 
                as your app grows.

            User Interface and User Experience Improvements           
            <p>
                I review existing interfaces to make them more intuitive and engaging. 
                Whether it’s adjusting layout, simplifying navigation, or improving load times, 
                I focus on making the experience smooth for every user.

            Performance Optimization
            <p>
                I analyze front end bundle sizes and server response times, 
                then apply best practices—like code splitting, lazy loading, 
                and caching—to make your application snappier.

            Code Audits and Refactoring
            <p>
                I examine your existing codebase to identify areas for improvement. 
                This might involve cleaning up duplicated logic, ensuring consistent style, 
                or reorganizing files so that future updates become easier.

            Ongoing Maintenance and Support
            <p>
                After launch, I monitor logs and address any bugs that arise. I keep dependencies up to date, 
                apply security patches, and make incremental enhancements based on user feedback.

            Deployment and DevOps Setup
            <p>
                I configure hosting, set up continuous integration pipelines, 
                and automate deployments so new versions roll out without downtime.
                Whether you need a simple static site host or a fully containerized server environment, 
                I handle the details.

            Technical Consultation and Planning
            <p>
                If you’re starting a new project, I can help translate your ideas into a clear roadmap.
                I advise on architecture choices, estimate timelines, 
                and recommend tools or libraries that best fit your needs.
